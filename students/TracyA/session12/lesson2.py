# Assignment summary:
# 1) Write a generator to find and print all of Ed Sheeranâ€™s tracks
#  from the data set. Submit your generator expression and the titles of
#  Edâ€™s tracks.
# 2) Write a closure to capture high energy tracks - anything over 8.0
#  Submit your code and the tracks it finds: artist name, track name and
#  energy value.

# Load data
music = pd.read_csv("featuresdf.csv")

       if artist == "Ed Sheeran")

# ['Shape of You', 'Castle on the Hill', 'Galway Girl', 'Perfect']
