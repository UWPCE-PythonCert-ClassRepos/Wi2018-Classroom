    "> The venerable master Qc Na was walking with his student, Anton. Hoping to prompt the master into a discussion, Anton said “Master, I have heard that objects (and classes) are a very good thing - is this true?” Qc Na looked pityingly at his student and replied, “Foolish pupil - objects are merely a poor man’s closures.”\n",
    "\n",
    "> Chastised, Anton took his leave from his master and returned to his cell, intent on studying closures. He carefully read the entire “Lambda: The Ultimate…” series of papers and its cousins, and implemented a small Scheme interpreter with a closure-based object system. He learned much, and looked forward to informing his master of his progress.\n",

    "> On his next walk with Qc Na, Anton attempted to impress his master by saying “Master, I have diligently studied the matter, and now understand that objects are truly a poor man’s closures.” Qc Na responded by hitting Anton with his stick, saying “When will you learn? Closures are a poor man’s object.” At that moment, Anton became enlightened.\n",

    "* Objects have methods.\n",
    "* Closures are methods — they are defined and behave like functions, but like object methods they carry internal state and take it into account when returning results.\n",
    "* Objects can, and generally do, carry mutable state.\n",
    "* Closures can, and often do, carry mutable state.\n",
    "* Objects control access to their attributes — their internal state — through Properties and Python’s lexical scoping rules. By default however object attributes are externally accessible.\n",
    "* Closures by nature tend to close around their internal state and thereby prevent external access, thus in terms of access to internal state, internal attributes, this is the opposite of the default behavior of an object. In accordance with Python’s Consenting Adults policy a closure’s internal state is still accessible via its ``__closure__`` dunder, but this violates the spirit of a closure — so do so at your own risk.\n",

    "3.  When calculating a return value the internal function, ``return_function``, uses both the ``internal state`` passed into the closure on line 1 when the closure was first defined, and also the arguments that will be passed into it later when it is used as a stand-alone function.\n",
