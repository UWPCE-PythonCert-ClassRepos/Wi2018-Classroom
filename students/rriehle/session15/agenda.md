Agenda for class.


Prelim questions
================

Any additions to the agenda?

Zoom
----

Remind me to repeat questions, etc.

Projects!
---------

I have the sense that most folks are starting to find traction.


Topics
======

Meta Programming
----------------

I think I did a crappy job of talking about getattr/setattr, because I never disceted their call signatures....

...and noboday asked me any questions.  Ahem.

Does everyone understand how they work or should we look at that?

Meta-mailroom -- How's it going?

Code, code, whose got some code?


Logging & Debugging
-------------------

If you can't find resources and files referenced in the material, check my directory in the repo.

Testing
-------

Test frameworks

  Unittest

  Nose/nose2

  Pytest  (we have a winner)

How do these things work?

Linting, Coverage, Flake, McCabe

  Some of this is built into your IDE, or perhaps there are plugins for your editor

  PyCharm, Sublime, vi, Atom

Mocks

Joe's example involves depencency injection... what's that?

Shall we look at some real code?

Missing rescources?  Ditto, see my folder in the repo.

Hypothesis... if we have time maybe.


Exercises
---------

Let's read through them together.


Random
------

I forgot my wallet today... and need to take a ferry after class tonight.

Could I borrow $10 from someone?

(fer real, no joke)
