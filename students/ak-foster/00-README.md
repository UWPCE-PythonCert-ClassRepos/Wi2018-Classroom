####Welcome to my directory!
*For each exercise, I will create a new directory containing python files for that exercise; 
add it to my repo and push to my fork on gitHub.*

**A little about me:**
- From this course, I hope to build the skills necessary to create my own product prototypes. 
- My interest in Python started when created a script that makes paying my student loans easier. :)
- I work as a Product Manager at Amazon (4 years).
