# IPAVe (IP Address Visualizer) How Do I Work With You?

# Get setup

1. create a directory named t25 *(this is for everyone's convenience in finding the repo after it's been downloaded)*
1. cd into your t25 directory
1. Log into your github.com account using a web browser
1. navigate to [here](https://github.com/mobycoder001/IPAVe)
1. clone this repository *(it looks alot like the class repository (go to the next step))*
1. cd to t25/Wi2018-Classroom/students/mark/ProjectProposals/ *(Look for the README.md file (this is the project summary file))*
1. checkout the branch currentproject (this has all the thing we are working on, make your changes here)
1. *(see alternate workflow / skip this step if it sounds too complex // (why this step? reduces merge conflicts if they are a concern)*
1. commit your changes to the branch
1. git push
1. Let someone in the project slack channel know you've got some code to be reviewed ( @channel "hey I pushed code" // there's a slack plugin for that right?)

### how to submit code to this repo?  
Create a pull request from your currentproject branch **note I think once I add you to this project you won't have to fork it, so get me your "git name"!

#### alternate workflow
- **insert after step 8** *(skip this section if it sounds complex, just make changes in the branch **currentproject** )*
    1. checkout the branch currentproject
    1. from currentproject, create a branch with "your_name"
    1. do a git branch -a -v (you'll see you have the same hash number for your branch and the currentproject branch)
    1. checkout your branch: git checkout "your_name"
    1. make changes, commit, change, push, pull, whatever 'till your heart is content
    1. git pull (get any upstream changes)
    1. git push (send your changes to your branch on github)
    1. git checkout currentproject
    1. git merge currentproject (fix any merge conflicts)
    1. git push when merge conflicts are resolved
    1. git checkout "your_name", continue to work and make changes in your project


### How to we submit code to the class repo?
1. The build master will merge the *currentproject* branch into the master branch, at regular intervals the master branch will be submitted to the class repository via a pull request and Instructor1 and Instructor2 will be asked to take a look at it (we all have copies of this code on our machines)
1. Instructor1 and Instructor2 can also see all of our code on a direct link to this repo or via a cloning of the repository to thier local machines

*notes:
* we all haove both repos, we will see our published changes in the class repo and our working changes in the currentproject in this repo
* This seems complex?  Why do it this way?
  - By doing this in a separate fork/repository, we can commit and share code as often as we like without waiting for a pull request to see each others commits (if we use the class repo, we're going to be waiting on a pull request, we use our own repos, it's going to be extremely difficult to review each others changes)


# I'm excited to get going and conribute code! What's next?
- send me an @username slack message with your git ID and asking to be added to the mobycoder001 group
> "Hi my name is "your_name_here" and my git ID is "git_id", I' like to join and contribute to your project, please add me to your org


# environment setup
- see environment setup in this repo / 00_env_setup/README.md

Am I working on environment setup or just munging data files?
- That's up to you where you contribue, some people will pull data, some will munge data, some will present data, we can do it!
