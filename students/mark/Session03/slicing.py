Tasks

Write some functions that take a sequence as an argument, and return a copy of that sequence:

    - with the first and last items exchanged.
    - with every other item removed.
    - with the first 4 and the last 4 items removed, and then every other item in between.
    - with the elements reversed (just with slicing).
    - with the middle third, then last third, then the first third in the new order.

NOTE: These should work with ANY sequence â€“ but you can use strings to test, if you like.

Your functions should look like:

def exchange_first_last(seq):
    return a_new_sequence



Tests:

a_string = "this is a string"
a_tuple = (2, 54, 13, 12, 5, 32)

assert exchange_first_last(a_string) == "ghis is a strint"
assert exchange_first_last(a_tuple) == (32, 54, 13, 12, 5, 2)

Write a test or two like that for each of the above functions.
