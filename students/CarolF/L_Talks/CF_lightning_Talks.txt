Topic of Choice: Biopython

Interest/background
Former Molecularbiologist with interest in Bioinformatics
Quick Indeed search of Bioinformatics related jobs identified Python as key requirement

What is Biopython?
1. Collection of Python tools/modules for Bioinformatics and computational biology.
2. Identified as a good collection for those knowing Python, beginner programmers, for developing larger programs and sharing. PMID 12230038.
3. Key 2009 publication has over 1,130 Pubmed citations and 228 citations in 2017
4. Access at http://biopython.org/    
5. Repository available on Github
6. Most Recent Release Biopython 1.70, released July 10, 2017

Relevance of Biopython:
1. Used by scientists to programmatically retrieve, analyze and share their data
2. Intended to reduce code duplication
3. A part of the Open Bioinformatics Foundation- promoting Open source and Open science in research

Examples of Biopythons capabilities:
1. Sequence analysis of biologically relevant molecules--DNA, RNA, protein, sugars?
2. It can read and write to many different file formats
3. Tools to programmatically interface (and exchange data) with online data repositories (NCBI, Expasy, etc)
4. It can provide shell wrappers to reuse the same code
5. Tools for motif identifications (think Biology regular expressions- a pattern of aas, nts, etc)
