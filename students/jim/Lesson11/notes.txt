For associating various fields together, use zip.
zip(music.whatever, music.this, music.that) if x[0] > 5 and x[1] < 2 will return
tracks where whatever is greater than 5 and this is less than 2

Also wrap list() around zip to ensure the right data structure

mylist[::-1] returns reverse

def fibo_gen():
    a,b = 0,1
    while True:
        yield b
        a,b = b,a+b

Closure: (??)

def make_average():
    count, total = 0, 0

    def averager(new_value):
        count += 1
        total += new_value
        return total / count
    return averager
