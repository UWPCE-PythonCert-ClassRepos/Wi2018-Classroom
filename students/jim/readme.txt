This is an update to my student readme file.

My name is James Blackburn, or Jim -- I answer to both. I am currently in the
midst of a master's degree in Computational Linguistics at UW, but the last few
courses are going to be really difficult without a more solid foundation in
Python (which is why I'm here). Python is a great choice for natural language
processing.

Hobbies include: Hiking, camping, reading, cooking, linguistics and language,
and travel. Apart from English I speak Chinese (Mandarin) and Spanish.
