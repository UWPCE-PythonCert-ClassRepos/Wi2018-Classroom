There are a few issues with recursive.py.


First, since we're going to debug it with pdb, I had to rename the "n"
to "num" because n is already "next" in pdb. I'm not sure if that was 
intentional, but that was a good refresher on why "n" is a crappy name.


Next, this function has no breakpoint/ return value if it gets to less
than 2 and wasn't a power of 2 to begin with. 


So, as we get deeper and deeper into the recursion the "n" (or "num")
gets divided by 2 forever. You can see this below where we see that
num is 0.00091552734375 and will keep diminishing by half.


To fix this, I'd put an "elif n < 1: return False" on line 6 in 
recursive.py.
